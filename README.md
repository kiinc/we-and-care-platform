## 📈 How We'll Train the AI Engine

- Collect anonymized logs from facility operations and patient vital signs
- Apply data cleaning + normalization → feature engineering
- Models: LSTM for time-series, XGBoost for tabular patterns
- Feedback loop through mobile app engagement data
- Continuous learning with real-world user feedback
